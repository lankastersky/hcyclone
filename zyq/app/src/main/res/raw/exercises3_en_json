Try to take it out of there. <p>2 Raise your arms, spreading them out to the sides, mentally extend them to the reflection of the Moon, lower them into the pond and take the Moon from the water. On breathing in you scoop up the Moon grabbing it with the hands and imagining it to be the real Moon. Breathing in begins with a mental extension of the arms. <p>3 Lift the Moon up, mentally reducing it in size. While lifting the Moon, there is almost no breathing in. <p>4 While holding your breath, bring the Moon through the Mintan point at the level of your eyebrows (the projection of the Third Eye) inside your brain, to the upper Dan Tian. When you move the Moon ball in the upper Dan Tian, try to feel how it is going inside your brain. <p>5 Then relax the body and, while exhaling smoothly, lower the Moon along the central channel into the lower Dan Tian and reduce it to the smallest volume possible. At first, when you scoop up the Moon, it’s big like the regular Moon. But when you lead it inside, it shrinks to the size of the luminous point. <p>In the process of moving the Moon down, you can close your eyes and look at it, and then open your eyes. <p>This way we accept the Moon eight times. Each successive Moon fuses with the preceding one. At the same time, white light appears in the lower Dan Tian which becomes brighter from each Moon. <p>6 Similarly, we accept the Moon into the middle and upper Dan Tian 8 times. In total, we accept twenty four Moons this way. But when we look into this channel, we see only three Moons - one in each Dan Tian.",

But as you assume the pose of the stage III Big Tree, you morph into a tree instantaneously, not gradually as in the preceding stages. <p>4 At the same time, you must imagine and then see that standing in front of you is you, yourself — your “second you”, as if your double is also practicing this exercise. <p>5  Having seen your double, try to see the face: try to see that your “second you” is looking at you. Actually, during the Stage III of Big Tree practice you look at each other. Sometimes, however, your double may have his or her side or back to you. <p>6 On finishing Big Tree, slowly bring the energy ball to the upper Dan Tian. Then lower it through the Zhong-Mai central channel to the middle Dan Tian and lower it further to the lower Dan Tian.

To do this, imagine and feel how your navel increases in size: grows in size and becomes bigger and bigger and then begins to move beyond your body limits. <p>4 After that, it starts to open up like a flower bud. Its petals become bigger and bigger. As they continue  enlarging, at the same time they begin to curve around eventually enveloping you by linking up from the back. Thus, your navel turns inside out exposing the side that previously had been inside, and it envelops you. Now its internal surface is the external surface of a ball in which you find yourself. This surface is capable of absorbing both energy and nutritional substances from the environment. <p>5 Try to feel how the navel takes in energy and substances from the environment. During breathing, you begin to feel the movement of your navel in time with your breathing, as if you are breathing through it. And then you begin to feel that through this turned inside out navel you breathe energy, absorb it. <p>Feel the navel and look at yourself inside of this ball ... Keep this image for a long time, and later you’ll feel that you don’t want to eat and don’t need food. <p>6 As you complete the exercise, mentally return your navel to its initial state. To do this, you need to imagine all the processes in the reverse order. To do this, imagine all the processes in reverse order. Imagine that the ball becomes unhooked from behind: the petals enveloping you disengage and begin to shrink, as they become smaller and smaller, they gradually curl into a bud which is then drawn into the navel, and finally, the navel assumes its usual shape. Then it begins to shrink, hides inside our body and returns to its normal size and initial state. <p>7 Put your hands on the navel, concentrate the  qi inside of the lower Dan Tian. <p>8 Then stand up and shake yourself a little on the heels to relax the body. <p> To increase the sensitivity in this practice, you can perform the next training.
