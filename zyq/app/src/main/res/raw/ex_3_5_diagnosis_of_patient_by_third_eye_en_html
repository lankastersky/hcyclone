There are often some doubts if a person can see the right picture, how we can separate the picture that we receive with the Third Eye from an image our own imagination creates. If you create a picture yourself, it’s not stable but moves. It isn’t a dynamic picture of the organ when it looks like watching a film; it looks like just the image of the organ begins to change randomly, in leaps.
<p>First: if in your thoughts something changes, then the image also changes, because you created it. But if we really see with the Third Eye, the picture remains stable.
<p>Second: in your heart you don’t feel completely certain that what you see corresponds to reality.
