Bad, sick qi, as a rule, does not stick to the ball. After some time working with it, you can mentally strengthen it and begin the massage again.
<p> With a general massage, you should have an in-yang-ball in each palm. To do this, you need to mentally divide your in-yan-ball into two. With this ball you can work with yourself. It can be transferred from one hand to another and to any diseased area of ​​the body. The effect of the impact of the ball depends on the level of its energy.
<p> The in-yan-ball treatment method helps very well with hematomas, blood stasis, various kinds of hemorrhages. And if the blood stagnates for a long time, then functional changes already occur, and a tumor may develop from this hematoma. An ultrasound then often diagnoses a tumor because there is a condensation in that area, but in fact it is not a tumor yet but simply a stagnation of blood that needs to be “expelled” from there. This is the kind of massage that can be done.
<p> It often happens that with good health in general relatively young people go to the hospital with a stroke or heart attack. This is due to vascular disorders that are not visible to the naked eye. The reason may be just a slight narrowing of the small vessel. Such a massage can prevent such problems. If you feel or “see” such a malfunctioning, then you need to mentally focus on the fact that you put bad qi and stagnant blood with it from this area or organ down to the ground.

<b> Yin-Yang-ball cleaning </b>
<p> After treating the patient, it is desirable to clean the in-yan-ball. This can be done in several ways.
<p> Method 1
<br> - Place the inject-yang-ball in any palm and breathe through it according to the method of the I stage: inhale through the Laogong point of the other hand (either the legs, Baihui or any combinations of them, as we practiced in I stage), and exhale - through the hand with the ball imagining that bad qi we exhale through the in-yang-ball to infinity.
<br> - Run a few times. Then return the in-yan-ball to the lower Dan Tian in the same way that you removed it.
<p> If you did a massage in which you had two yang-balls, then when cleaning with the first method, you can breathe out through both palms and both balls.
<p> Method 2
<br> - Use the second method of breathing according to the second stage: make a slow breath of good qi over the entire surface of the body and bring it to the ball, and on the exhale throw the bad qi out of the ball abruptly to infinity.
<p> Run multiple times. Then return the in-yan-ball to the lower  Dan Tian.
<p> Method 3
<br> - Perform the 6th preparatory exercise for pre-cleaning in-yan-ball. Return the in-yang-ball to the lower  Dan Tian. Complete the cleaning practice with the 5th preparatory exercise. Run several times.
<p> Method 4
<br> - If you were treating yourself, the ball remained inside your body all the time but in the diseased area. Therefore, it must be moved to the lower Dan Tian, and then you perform the 5th preparatory exercise.
