Consciousness controls breathing, breathing controls Qi, Qi controls the blood. Big Tree practice can extend our life and our youth since we duplicate the pose of a tree, and like a tree, we begin to receive the Qi of Sky and the Qi of Earth. It is possible to achieve a similar effect if we imagine ourselves to be a child, an infant. Through the navel your contact with mother, with the Great Mother — with the entire Cosmo — is realized.
<p> If you practice this exercise regularly, you’ll come in contact with interesting phenomena: at first your skin will begin to change, then your character. Your skin will become fresher and tenderer — like that of a child. Your character will also become like that of a child, but there will be no change regarding knowledge and accumulated experience.
<p> While in the state of Quietness and calm, it’s possible to feel the pulsating of the navel like the beating of the heart. Then you begin to feel breathing in the navel and  the sensation emerges in you that it appears and disappears, that it is and isn’t. This breathing is synchronized with the rhythm of the Cosmos. Later you you’ll be able to feel that  the rhythms of breathing through the navel is different from the your own breathing or heartbeat — it coincide with the world around, with the rhythm of the Cosmos.
