After practicing <i> qigong </i>, a lot of <i> qi </i> energy accumulates in the body. When we think about an something, “staring” on the sides, chatting animatedly, the energy leaves our body — it radiates from the brain and follows the thought, the gaze to the point of attention. Therefore when practicing <i> qigong </i>, we say: <i> close your eyes and ears, close your mind and allow your energy to work inside your body </i>. </p>
<p> In order not to be distracted, in the process of learning <i> qigong </i> it is not recommended to visit places of entertainment, since the diversity and loud music dissipate energy. </p>
<p> When practicing <i> qigong</i>, in any conditions and under any circumstances you need to maintain a quite emotional state. When surges of emotions, you should not engage in <i> qigong </i> - it will be to no avail.
