One of the main exercises in <i> Zhong Yuan Qigong </i> is Zhang Zhuang - “Big Tree” and the accompanying preparatory and final exercises. </p>
<p> The main distinguishing feature of all <i> qigong exercises </i> is the need to use thought, imagination. Exercises that are elementary at first glance require the participation of consciousness - deep concentration and the ability to get into character. </p>
<p> <i> All the exercises of the 1st stage are characterized by three semantic levels </i>. </p>
<p> <i> The first level of meaning </i> is the lowest - just a physical exercise for regulating the body (developing joints or opening certain zones in the spine). </p>
<p> <i> The second semantic level </i> is associated with certain ideas designed to develop and enhance sensory skills. At the same time the regulation of consciousness is carried out. </p>
<p> <i> The third semantic level </i> is the identification of oneself with a concrete role, the entering into the state of qigong and practice of new qualities, the possibility of information exchange with the animal and plant world. </p>
<p> For a certain category of people (with a weak imagination), exercises can seem difficult. However, with systematic studies, these difficulties can be overcome and learnability (mastering the entire volume of the material) at the first stage is 80-90%. </p>
<p> For successful and safe learning in the <i> Zhong Yuan Qigong system </i> certain rules should be observed. </p>
<h3> Rules for Practicing Zhong Yuan Qigong </h3>
<p> 1. Performing any exercise should be in a convenient place for you, in loose clothing and shoes without heels (or barefoot), preferably without makeup and in a calm mood.
<p>
2. You can not practice <i> qigong </i> with a full stomach or a strong feeling of hunger, and after a moderate meal you must endure an interval of at least 30 minutes.
<p>
3. In the process of practicing the body and mind should be relaxed. You should not intensively concentrate on the views, images, sensations. Follow the rule: "It seems - there is, it seems - no".
<p>
4. Practice regularly without long breaks and overloads, so that favorable changes in the body occur naturally and have time to be fixed.
<p>
5. Do not set a specific goal when performing any exercises, do not wish to experience any sensations or phenomena at any time, do not force the mind, consciousness to control <i> qi </i> in the process of practice. This can lead to the appearance of hallucinations, the loss of a sober critical attitude to what is happening to you, the tremor of the limbs, the head or the whole body. Everything should happen without the participation of consciousness. You can only observe detachedly, giving the processes taking place in you the natural course of development.
<p>
The stronger you want to make something happen, the less chance you have of it.
<p>
6. After completing any exercises, hands should be folded on the Xia Dan Tian.
<p>
If in the process of practicing someone interrupted you or something distracted you, then before you enter into a conversation or leave the classroom, you must fold your arms to Xia Dan Tian, concentrating <i> qi </i> in it. If something scared you while doing the exercises, put your hands on Xia Dianti and adjust your breathing.
<p>
8. Before practicing, you should be prepared not to react to sudden, loud noises, if any, during your practice.
<p>
9. If you do strength training or sport professionally, then after your workout routine, you can begin to practice <i> qigong </i> only after calming down your body and mind. Intense physical activity (running, jumping, working with a barbell, etc.) is also possible after an interval of at least 30 minutes.
<p>
10. In the process of intensive studies, it is necessary to limit the use of tonic beverages. As for food, the range and quantity of it are not limited - you can eat everything depending on the desire and need of the body. At some stage of the practice the practitioner just stops using certain foods in a natural way, such as meat, or there is a natural need to starve for a while. In all other cases, the enforced compulsory restriction on food is not recommended when practicing <i> Zhun Yuan Qigong </i>.
<p>
All other rules are set out in the description of the relevant exercises.
<p>
Remember: <i> To achieve the highest levels of qigong, smoking and alcohol are unacceptable. </i> </p>
