<p> Breathing through the skin helps to get enough oxygen from the body by saturating the blood in the skin and speeding up its circulation.
<p> Skin breathing is a very effective method of healing. But for the development of a human as a biological species, the development of skin respiration is simply necessary, without it it is impossible to practice the highest levels. On them we practice the state of silence, pause, then full stop of all processes in the body. The heart and lungs must stop their work. But the body still needs oxygen. And then our skin begins to breathe automatically. Therefore, it is possible to sit or lie down for several days without a breath and with a stopped heart, but death does not occur and the person does not die - he (or she) breathes through his skin.
<p> After the necessary training, the skin can breathe very well. After mastering the methods of breathing through the skin, a person acquires the ability to submerge in water or descend into the earth for a long time, sometimes more than twenty days. After all, there is also oxygen in the water and underground, and it is absorbed by the skin.
