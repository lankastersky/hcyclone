The “Small Celestial Circle” form is one of the most important in the Taoist system. In ancient China, it was called “boat driving along the river,” since the channels are similar to rivers. And in order to drive a boat along the river, there must be enough water in it, that is, <i> qi </i>. Therefore, for the successful development of the "Little Sky Circle", it is necessary to practice as much as possible those exercises that contribute to the accumulation of <i> qi </i>. </p>
<p> In the human body there are 12 normal energy channels and 8 miraculous. The most important of them are Du-May and Zhen-May, which control the work of all the other channels. The “Small Celestial Circle” is the path of <i> qi </i> with its constant circulation through the Du-May and Zhen-May channels. To clarify the practice, we say that from the Baihui point on the top of the head down to the lower Dan Tian and further to the Huiyin point in the crotch, the Zhen-May channel (actually it starts from the Chengjiang point on the lower jaw), and from the Huiyin upward to the point of Baihui is the Du-Mai channel. The “Small Celestial Circle” symbolizes the rotation of the Moon around the Earth - one month according to the lunar calendar. There is also the "Big Celestial Circle." It symbolizes the rotation of the earth around the sun. </p>
<p> Note: It is easier to perform this exercise, if you first "start" the movement of qi with the help of breathing. Then you should do it 5-10 minutes in the first variant, and then continue 20-30 minutes on the second.
<p> <b> Related Effects and Phenomena </b>
<p> 1. <i> Therapeutic effect </i> </p>
<p> When performing this exercise, sometimes, as with Zhang Zhuang, pain also occurs. The reason is the same - the passage of <i> qi </i> through the spasm sections of the channels. Moving along Du-Mai and Zhen-Mai channels, <i> qi </i> activates energy in them, cleanses them from "stagnation", removes "blocks", and this has a healing effect on organs and areas of the body located along channels - in fact, all internal organs, nasopharynx, eyes, brain, spine, central nervous system. The process of recovery from flu, colds, high temperature is accelerated. </P>
<p> 2. <i> Gain intelligence </i> </p>
<p> When <i> qi </i> enters the Du-Mai channel, the brain sometimes has a feeling of "filling" or "bursting" the brain. It is known that about 20% of brain cells work for an ordinary person, and the rest are inactive. A person does not have time to perceive an ever-increasing amount of information from various branches of science, technology, art, and social life in a familiar way (from books and from teachers). We require special methods of brain development. Analysis of thousands of years of experience and recent scientific studies have shown that this exercise is the best for the natural activation of brain cells and the development of intelligence. </p>
<p> 3. <i> Activating the third eye area </i> </p>
<p> When <i> qi </i> passes from the Baihui point down the Zhen-May channel, it enters the area of ​​the third eye and activates biologically active points in this zone. This is accompanied by a number of phenomena that we talked about when studying the “Big Tree” form - flashes of light, luminescence, tingling, pain, pressure, etc. When enough <i> qi</i> comes in, it becomes active, and this leads to the opening of the third eye and the emergence of another channel of perception of the surrounding world. The work with the third eye is included in the program of the 3rd stage of <i> Zhong Yuan Qigong </i>, but the students are introduced with the individual elements during the second one. </P>
<p> Sometimes at the initial stage of training, some practitioners of <i> qi </i> move more easily in the opposite direction: up the Zhen-May channel and down Du-May. </p>
<p> An exercise is considered to be mastered if <i> qi </i> automatically constantly moves around the “Small Celestial Circle”, and you can track this movement at any time by switching your attention to it.
