<p> Lower Dan Tian is an energy center where energy can be stored and converted. If we work with it in a special way, then the process of generating energy will begin in it, and this will cause a feeling of warmth, then heat. Here our sex hormones can transform into qi. For the production of qi, we use our mind and apply the method of visualization.
<p> During this exercise you need to imagine that there is a red energy ball in your lower Dan Tian and you are looking at it.
<p> You do not have to constantly think about it and constantly focus your attention on this, otherwise the energy will rise up to the brain and cause a feeling of a big heavy head. But you should not forget about the ball, otherwise you will fall asleep. Therefore, during the practice of this exercise, the eyes should be covered so that some light still falls through them.
<p> <b> Health Effect </b>
<p> While practicing the qi transformation exercise, we are in a state of calm, so all our internal organs return to their normal state automatically, by themselves. When we relax and calm down, our energy increases and begins to flow properly within the energy channels.
<p> When visualizing, the back part of the brain begins to work, and the frontal one, in charge of the thinking process, calms down, as if falling asleep. Then thoughts do not interfere with the natural processes inside our body, and it can switch to automatic control of its state.
<p> Practice Yang-Qi and exercises to activate your ball are energy exercises. Therefore, in the case of diseases of physical organs located near the area of ​​the lower Dan Tian, a person can feel pain as when performing the Big Tree.
<p> This is a healing process associated with the opening of energy channels. Especially often such pain symptoms occur in women with gynecological disorders and in people with adhesions after surgery. Discomfort can also be caused by colitis and disorders in the urogenital area. However, the practice of red hot and not just a warm ball helps to get rid of these problems.
<p> <b> Anti-Aging Effect </b>
<p> Practicing Yang Qi Gong allows us to transform our body, improve brain function, rejuvenate.
<p>Modern scientific research has confirmed that this practice allows you to convert DNA and RNA into a form of energy that feeds the brain and activates its cells, forcing them to work more actively. But in addition to the brain, spinal cord cells are also activated.
<p> However, an exercise can be considered learned if, no matter what daily activities you do, you will always feel warmth in the lower Dan Tian, and during practice you will feel intense heat, sometimes bordering on pain.
<p> It is this heat that speaks about the process of transforming hormones into qi, and then your body will begin to change. Without this hot red ball it is very difficult to improve your health.
<p> It is better if you specifically allocate time for this practice, but do it at the slightest opportunity: while sitting in transport, reading books, working on a computer, during any type of activity or communication that allows periodic switching of their attention to the area of ​​lower Dan Tian. In these cases, you can practice without using your hands, mentally, as if remembering your ball from time to time, checking its condition and sensations from it in the lower Dan Tian.
<p> <b> Developmental Effect </b>
<p> With regular practice, heat appears in the lower Dan Tian. Usually in this case the energy from the lower Dan Tian automatically begins to rise up to the brain and reaches the area of ​​the Third Eye. Sensitive people can sense this movement of energy. When it reaches the brain, you will see something like flashes of lightning, as in the practice of the Big Tree. And in the same way light of different colors appears later. This is the first phenomenon that signals the beginning of the work of the Third Eye.
<p> And with the rise of energy upward, intuition and creativity are developed in solving problems in any kind of activity and in everyday life.
