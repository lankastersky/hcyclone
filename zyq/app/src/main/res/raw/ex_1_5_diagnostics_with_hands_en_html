<p> The first part of the diagnosis is to identify the problem area, and not the specific organ; then the identification of specific problems in this area.<p> The second step to be done is to focus on the organ that you are going to diagnose. For example, you imagine that you begin to diagnose the lungs. You can imagine exactly which part of the lungs you are diagnosing, say on the left lung you are looking at the top or base. If you want to be able to determine which organ is unhealthy, you must have a holistic view of the structure of the human body.
<p> If the <i> qi </i> of healthy palms is in contact with the healthy part of the body, then as a rule no particular sensations arise. However, the three organs in our body give specific sensations:
<ol>
<li> The kidneys belong to the elements of water, so if they are healthy, they feel cool. If they emanate cold, heat, tingling, or anything else, then there is a pathology. </Li>
<li> The heart belongs to the element of fire, therefore, when diagnosing the heart (if it is healthy), there is a feeling of heat. Any other sensations, including strong heat, signal diseases. </Li>
<li> The lungs belong to the elements of metal. If they are healthy, then they either do not give any sensations at all, or a slight vibration (like the sound after the bell strikes), or a lot of tingling in the palms. Other sensations talk about deviations from the norm. </Li>
</ol>
<p> All other organs and body parts in the normal state do not give any sensations. Different sensations speak about different diseases, but each of these sensations are purely individual. Therefore, only a large practice can give the opportunity to accumulate the correct criteria for assessing the patient's condition. However, some types of diseases give certain sensations, for example, a cool streak or a breeze when moving a hand along some part of the body indicates the likelihood of the surgery. The sensation of hotness arises in the inflammatory process of both internal organs and joints - knees, elbows, shoulders. And if in these areas you feel a cool or a whiff of breeze, then it can be a disease such as arthritis, arthrosis.

<p> <b> Related Effects and Phenomena </b>
<p> Sometimes the patient begins to feel pain at some point during the diagnosis, and if the pain was before the start of the diagnosis, then it may worsen. The fact is that after practicing <i> qigong </i>, the field of <i> qi </i> around your palms is usually much stronger than that of the patient. Therefore, in the process of diagnosing with <i> qi </i> of your palms, it affects those areas where the patient has a disease. And then - according to the already known scheme: the additional <i> qi </i> he (or she) gets in this section tries to go through the spasm section of the channel. </p>
<p> Sometimes a patient has a faint or close to its condition. This happens in several cases: </p>
<ul>
<li> If the patient is hypersensitive but at the same time physically weak, and you do not control your energy enough. Then, when diagnosing, a lot of energy is transferred to the patient; </li>
<li> in the interaction between mother and child (they almost always have the same type of <i> qi </i> structure). </li>
<li> if the patient has a bad heart. </li>
</ul>
