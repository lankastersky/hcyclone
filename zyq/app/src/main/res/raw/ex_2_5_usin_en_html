One of the causes of disease is that our internal organs do not interact in the way they should.
<p> We know that for the treatment of many diseases it is necessary to open narrowed or blocked sections of the channels with the flow of qi. Inside our body organs are also connected by channels. Besides the fact that it is necessary to open points on the surface of the skin, we must also open points that connect the channels with our organs.
<p> If in this situation we check each of the organs, then they can not identify any kind of pathology, but at the same time the body has various problems. Special regulation of the work of the bodies in accordance with the theory of U-syn helps them better interact with each other - synchronizes their work and removes problems.
<p> U-syn literally translates to "Five Movements." Sometimes it is called the system of five elements or the system of five primary elements: water, wood, earth, fire and metal. These elements can be represented by the so-called U-syn circle.
<p> From the point of view of qi, different organs have different colors if the organs are healthy. If the color or light emanating from the organ changes in some way in comparison with the usual one, then this means that most likely there are some problems with this organ. Also, each organ has its own tone of sounds.
