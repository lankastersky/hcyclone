We accept the Moon because the goal of this practice is to calm down the frontal part of the brain that is the thought processes.
<p>Translated from Chinese, the eighth exercise is called "Immortal smells enter your body, immortal aromas saturate, soak your body."
<p>In accordance with Image Medicine, eight worlds are higher than ours. Each world has its own aroma. We can absorb them. We can even see the flowers that emanate from these aromas. And our body is saturated with them in this practice. Then the energy of these smells helps us to rise to the next level, to the higher world.
<p>The smell coming from another world cleanses and changes our body so that our soul can later depart from it. This exercise allows the body to receive substances from worlds of various levels and also provides an opportunity to become familiar with sensations that arise in the practitioner at the moment of his or her soulâ€™s departure from the body. Thus, this exercise is intended to help you prepare for the next flight of your soul. And only after the soul really does leave the physical body, we can understand truly what the physical body, spirit, soul, and energy are.
