The first semantic level: physical exercise developing the lumbosacral spine and leg joints. In the lumbar region there is a difficult opening Minmen point. In this zone a lot of bad <i> qi </i> accumulates, and this in turn affects the blood circulation of this area. There are stagnation, discomfort, pain which can cause cancer. This exercise contributes to the normal functioning of the above areas. </P>
<p> The second semantic level: in this area are the kidneys. In the qigong system the <i> qi </i> energy of the kidneys belongs to the element of water. This means that <i> qi </i> of water and <i> qi </i> of the kidneys are the same. If you can not only imagine but also feel yourself in the water which rotates and boils, then the kidneys will be washed with such water. <i> Qi </i> of this water will pass through your kidneys washing them and removing bad stagnant <i> qi </i>. Moreover, here the kidneys are not just a separate organ but a system of organs - the entire urogenital area. And this exercise helps to normalize the functions of the whole system. </P>
<p> The third semantic level: imagine and feel like a dragon. Identify yourself with it. If you enter the state of qigong while performing this exercise, you will understand that dragons exist, they are the product of other worlds, they are real, and you lay the foundation for your future possibilities of communicating with other worlds, other civilizations, other entities.
