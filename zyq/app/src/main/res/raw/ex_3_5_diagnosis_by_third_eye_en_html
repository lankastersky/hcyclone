After practicing for a while, a white light emerges when your eyes are closed. This is the beginning of the working of the Third Eye. But at this beginning stage nothing is visible. Light of a different color will then appear. But even this isn’t enough. Only after you learn how to control the movement of this light — radiating it from yourself and receiving it back — you will be able to see objects illuminated by this light. Therefore the first thing you have to learn is how to see the light.
<p>Everyone can diagnose with the Third Eye if he or she has strong energy, because this is the means by which we send energy and receive information. This information helps us to create an image in front of our mental gaze — on an internal “screen.” And such an image can provide the answer to our question. For doctors or healers, this function of the Third Eye is simply a necessity.
<p>To acquire these abilities, learn how to enter the state of Quietness very quickly — in one minute — and how not think about anything. In this state, look at another person very intensively. Here your energy (usually this is the energy of light and fog combined, although the energy of fog is dominant) is emitted and “spots” the patient. Then you can clearly see what you’re looking at, what you’ve tuned in to.
<p>With this seeing, turn your attention to the color. While you still can’t see everything clearly, look at the organ as a whole — for example, the brain — and try to compare the color in its various parts noticing whether or not the color is the same throughout the organ. If there’s some kind of problem, some disease on a physical level, you’ll be able to see that the color isn’t the same: where the disease is, the color will be dark, gray or intense.
<p>In the beginning stage of seeing, the Third Eye can’t work in a discerning way: it sees everything immediately and has difficulty determining an illness. But after training, you develop the ability to disclose the problem.
